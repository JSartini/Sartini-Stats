I am a 5th year PhD student in the [Biostatistics Department](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics) at the [Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu).

I am concluding my degree requirements, with tentative graduation in Spring 2026. My PhD advisors are [Dr. Scott Zeger](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/784/scott-l-zeger) and [Dr. Ciprian Crainiceanu](http://ciprianstats.org). For my applied work, I am mentored by [Dr. Elizabeth Selvin](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1882/elizabeth-selvin) and [Dr. Michael Fang](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/4192/michael-fang). I previously completed a BSE in [Operations Research and Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu) from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu) in 2021.

Motivated by the increasing complexity and nuance of data collected by studies employing new physiological monitoring technology (e.g. wearable devices like accelerometry, continuous glucose monitoring, or patch electrocardiograms), my research combines a rigorous Bayesian statistical approach with computational techniques to produce practical software producing uniquely valid inference by jointly modeling all sources of uncertainty.

When not working on methods or analyzing a dataset, I can usually be found either weightlifting or running.
