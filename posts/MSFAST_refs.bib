	abstract = {The authors conducted a 2-year (1989-1991) community-based longitudinal study in a shantytown in Lima, Peru, to examine the effect of Cryptosporidium parvum infection on child growth during the year following the onset of infection. A cohort of children, aged 0-3 months at recruitment, was followed monthly for anthropometrics, weekly for stool samples, and daily for diarrheal status. Data from 185 children in the cohort permitted a comparison of growth in C. parvum-infected and noninfected children. The analyses fitted smooth, flexible curves with a linear random-effects model to estimate growth differences between C. parvum-infected and noninfected children. Children infected with C. parvum experienced growth faltering, both in weight and in height, for several months after the onset of infection, followed by a period of catch-up growth. Younger children took longer to catch up in weight than did older children. Catch-up growth, however, did not occur in children infected between ages 0 and 5 months. These children did not catch up in height, and one year after infection they exhibited an average deficit of 0.95 cm (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.38-1.53) relative to noninfected children of similar age. Stunted children who became infected also did not catch up in either weight or height, and one year after infection they exhibited a height deficit of 1.05 cm (95\% CI 0.46-1.66) relative to noninfected, stunted children of similar age. These results indicate that Cryptosporidium parvum has a lasting adverse effect on linear (height) growth, especially when acquired during infancy and when children are stunted before they become infected.},

	abstract = {Linear growth retardation during childhood is a determinant of short stature and impaired capacities in adults of developing countries. To study the effect of diarrhea on height during childhood, the authors followed a birth cohort of 224 Peruvian children for 35 months with records of daily diarrhea and monthly anthropometry. This study was conducted from April 1995 to December 1998. At 24 months of age, study children were 2.5 cm shorter than the US National Center for Health Statistics/World Health Organization growth reference. A diarrheal prevalence of 2.3\% in the first 24 months of life explained 2-27\% of this growth deficit. There was a 2-month delay before the effects of diarrhea on height became manifest. Height deficits were proportional to diarrheal prevalence. For example, children ill with diarrhea 10\% of the time during the first 24 months were 1.5 cm shorter than children who never had diarrhea. In addition, the adverse effects of diarrhea on height varied by age. Diarrhea during the first 6 months of life resulted in long-term height deficits that were likely to be permanent. In contrast, diarrhea after 6 months of age showed transient effects. Study results indicate that diarrhea control, especially during the first 6 months of life, is likely to improve linear growth in Peruvian children.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In endemic settings, Helicobacter pylori infection can occur shortly after birth and may be associated with a reduction in childhood growth.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigated what factors promote earlier age of first H. pylori infection and evaluated the role of H. pylori infection in infancy (6-11 months) versus early childhood (12-23 months) on height. We included 183 children near birth from a peri-urban shanty town outside of Lima, Peru. Field-workers collected data on socioeconomic status (SES), daily diarrheal and breast-feeding history, antibiotic use, anthropometrics, and H. pylori status via carbon 13-labeled urea breath test up to 24 months after birth. We used a proportional hazards model to assess risk factors for earlier age at first detected infection and linear mixed-effects models to evaluate the association of first detected H. pylori infection during infancy on attained height.
RESULTS: One hundred and forty (77\%) were infected before 12 months of age. Lower SES was associated with earlier age at first detected H. pylori infection (low vs middle-to-high SES Hazard ratio (HR) 1.59, 95\% CI 1.16, 2.19; p = .004), and greater exclusive breast-feeding was associated with reduced likelihood (HR 0.63, 95\% CI 0.40, 0.98, p = .04). H. pylori infection in infancy was not independently associated with growth deficits (p = .58). However, children who had their first detected H. pylori infection in infancy (6-11 months) versus early childhood (12-23 months) and who had an average number of diarrhea episodes per year (3.4) were significantly shorter at 24 months (-0.37 cm, 95\% CI, -0.60, -0.15 cm; p = .001).
DISCUSSION: Lower SES was associated with a higher risk of first detected H. pylori infection during infancy, which in turn augmented the adverse association of diarrheal disease on linear growth.},
